## DESCRIPTION

It is easy to let our food go to waste, especially with the scraps of food leftover from a week of cooking.  What are you supposed to do with the 1/2 an onion in the back of the fridge, or the jar of tomato sauce that is about to expire in the pantry.  With Cupboard Cleanout users never have to worry about throwing out groceries again.

Simply input your ingredients on the homepage of the app and a list of recipes will be curated immediately.
